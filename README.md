# Chatterbox
## What is it?
Chatterbox is a slackbot that gives you a message when you type in a number from 1-10 (some Easter eggs)
I made it to learn Python and to make a funny bot!

## How to self-host
### Here is a guide to self-host the bot:
1. Download the code
2. Run `pip install -m requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file and add `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=` with your slack bot token, and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN=` with the slack app token
4. Run `python app.py` or `python3 app.py`
